# Cook Once, Live Free 🍳

Sunday prep. Weekday freedom. Microwave approved.

This is a **no-accounts, offline MVP** that generates a weekly batch-cooking plan based on:
- region/country
- diet & allergies (hard exclusions)
- effort level (😮‍💨 minimal / 🙂 normal / 🔥 inspired)
- light goal presets (balanced / muscle / light / recovery / gourmet-ish)

It outputs:
- Sunday base dishes
- shared sides
- weekday carbs
- remix ideas
- a grouped shopping list you can copy, print, download as TXT, or download as a **PNG shopping card**
